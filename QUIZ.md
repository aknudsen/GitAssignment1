1. Explain how git enables saving code.
Git enables saving code by giving you a workspace, a staging area, and the repository. Code can be worked on in the workspace, moved to the staging area, and then committed to the repository.

2. Explain how git enables tracking code.
Git enables tracking code by logging every commit that the code goes through. It saves the entire directory at each commit. This allows a user to go back to a past commit if problems develop.

3. Explain how git enables sharing code.
Git enables sharing code by allowing a user to share a codebase with another user. Both user can then work on the code independently and develop different branches of the code.
